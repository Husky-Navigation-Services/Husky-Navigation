# Husky-Navigation
A full-stack Web App for navigation of the University of Washington Campus. Enables shortest-route calculation between buildings, bus stops, and the current location. Builds off the limited University of Washington Campus Map web app (https://www.washington.edu/maps/) that already exists in a campus-oriented way.
