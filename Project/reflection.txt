Front-End:

Throughout the project, we substantially improved our knowledge of front-end languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as we designed the webpage. We learned about new libraries and APIs, such as LeafletJS, Open Weather Map, and the Gmail API, as well as corresponding tools like GeoJSON. The scale of the project (roughly 1300 lines of front-end code) required us to include decent commmenting and have good communication. We enjoyed testing out new APIs, designs, and features, as well as working with feedback we received for our design. Debugging the code was sometimes challenging since we relied heavily upon "Ctrl-F" to find stylesheet components, callbacks, etc. Our TAs were particularly helpful when we discussed our early ideas for the project at its outset.

Back-End:

TBD
Idea: Include feedback from beta round as part of supplemental information.
