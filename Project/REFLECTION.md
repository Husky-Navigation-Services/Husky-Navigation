What did you learn during this project?

Throughout the project, on the front-end, we substantially improved our knowledge of front-end languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as we designed the webpage. We learned about new libraries and APIs, such as LeafletJS, Open Weather Map, and the Gmail API, as well as corresponding tools like GeoJSON. The scale of the project (roughly 1300 lines of front-end code) required us to include decent levels of commmenting and have good communication across our team. The communication element was particularly important to our team due to the speed at which we were working and the way in which our tasks heavily related with each other. We enjoyed testing out new APIs, designs, and features, as well as working with feedback we received for our design. Debugging the code was sometimes challenging since we relied heavily upon "Ctrl-F" to find stylesheet components, callbacks, etc. Our TAs were particularly helpful when we discussed our early ideas for the project at its outset.

What did you enjoy during this project?

Across our team what we enjoyed most was the way in which our project came together and how we were able to seamlessly integreate our modules together.
Idea: Include feedback from beta round as part of supplemental information. (We enjoyed hearing postive feedback from users)
