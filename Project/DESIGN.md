# Front-End
No framework (such as ReactJS, Vue, Angular), design website, or substantial DOM manipulation libraries were used to implement the front-end. It is plain HTML5/CSS3/JS. The full-screen map was implemented using LeafletJS, a JS library for interactive maps. The paths are displayed by adding a GeoJSON layer (generated in the back-end) to this map. Our weather data comes from Open Weather Map's API services, providing real-time data for anywhere in the world. The logo containging the Husky dog and location marker was designed and customized for this project by ourselves.
