# Front-End
No framework (such as ReactJS, Vue, Angular), design website, or substantial DOM manipulation libraries were used to implement the front-end. It is plain HTML5/CSS3/JS. The full-screen map was implemented using LeafletJS, a JS library for interactive maps. The paths are displayed by adding a GeoJSON layer (generated in the back-end) to this map. Our weather data comes from Open Weather Map's API services, providing real-time data for anywhere in the world. The logo containging the Husky dog and location marker was designed and customized for this project by our team "in house" (something that the team is very proud of). On the front-end a big focus for our team was not just coming up with a finished product but putting ourselves in the shoes of the user and thinking what features or components matter most deeply to them.

# Back-End 
The back-end was implemented by using a parser module to parse through files containing lines that translated to node and edge values. This was done in order to facilitate the use of a path-finding algorithm that attempted to find the least-cost path based on longest distance as the cost. The back-end was primarily implemented with java in an attempt to facilitate the most direct application of course material as possible. The desision made to use a server as the focal point of our back-end and to allow communication with the front-end via this method.
